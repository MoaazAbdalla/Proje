							Swimming has a certain physical feature compared to other sports branches. Water has a
							resistance. Overcoming this resistance requires certain motor characteristics (strength,
							speed, endurance, flexibility). Swimming movements need contractile musculature according to
							biomechanics, but this contraction is less than other sports branches. In weightlifting,
							more force is required to lift the barbell. All swimming muscles have a special structure
							because there is more isotonic, dynamic movement and less isometric movement in swimming. A
							swimmer's muscle has a thin, long structure and the muscle thickness is less.

							We can collect the benefits of tennis in three main groups as physical, psychological and
							social aspects. The most important physical benefits of tennis; it can be summarized as
							helping the body to burn fat in general, giving the individual agility, balance, flexibility
							and speed, and increasing body coordination. In addition to these physical benefits, tennis
							provides important contributions to the individual in a psychological sense, as it is a
							struggle against the opponent, partly against the wind and the sun. These benefits can be
							summarized as that tennis teaches the individual to struggle constantly, gives an
							understanding of responsibility, develops the concept of discipline, and teaches planning
							and strategy development in sports.

							Inevitably, many people in real life are also thought of in the abstract.
